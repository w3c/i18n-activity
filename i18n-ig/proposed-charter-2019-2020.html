      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>The Interest Group helps the   W3C Internationalization Working Group by providing advice and opinions from a larger group of people with knowledge in different languages and cultures as well as different aspects of Web architecture. The Interest Group also provides a forum to discuss issues related to the internationalization of the Web.</p>
<p>The Interest Group also allows IG participants to come together in task forces to investigate specific aspects of international support for the Web. Any documents produced by these task forces are published by the Internationalization Working Group. See a <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/layout">list of current task forces</a>.</p>
</section>



      <section id="deliverables">
        <h2>
          Deliverables
        </h2>
<p>The Interest Group as a whole does not produce any deliverables. Individual task forces may produce gap-analysis documents, and layout requirements documents, or other information that will be reviewed by and published by the Internationalization Working Group. See the GitHub pages for the individual task forces for links to such documents.</p>
<p>The IG produces no Rec-track documents. It only produces documents that are published as web pages or as Working Group Notes.</p>
</section>



      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>The Internationalization Interest Group provides a forum for announcements, discussion and advice for the Internationalization Working Groups. Members of the Internationalization Working Group are automatically subscribed to the Internationalization Interest Group. The WGs  use the i18n IG to obtain input from a larger group of people with knowledge in different languages and cultures as well as different aspects of Web architecture, and to report progress on their work, and solicit feedback.</p>
</section>



      <section class="participation">
        <h2 id="participation">
          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>Membership of the Internationalization Interest Group is open to the public; W3C Membership is not a prerequisite.</p>
        <p>Membership of the IG is signified by subscribing to one of the mailing lists managed by the IG. These include www-international@w3.org, and any of the specialist lists used by task forces or other special interest groups. To subscribe to a mailing list, send an email to &lt; list&gt;-request@w3.org, with 'subscribe' in the Subject. There is no time commitment for participation in the Interest Group.</p>
        <p>There may be more specific recommendations for participation in any task forces of the IG. These criteria are defined by the informative charter for that task force.</p>
      </section>



    <section id="communication">
        <h2>
          Communication
        </h2>
    <p>The main list of the Internationalization Interest Group  is <a href="mailto:www-international@w3.org">www-international@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/">public
archive</a>). There are also a number of specialised mailing lists for topics such as bidi, indic, CJK, etc. They are listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/groups/">the groups page</a> of the i18n site. Technical discussions, however, normally take place on  one of the GitHub repositories used for internationalization work at W3C. The IG mailing lists  principally  receive digests from those repositories notifying subscribers of changes to issues or of pull requests, and the minutes of the Internationalization Working Group are sent to www-international.</p>
<p>Task forces within the IG also have (publicly visible) administrative lists for internal, practical discussions.</p>
<p id="public">
      Technical discussions for this Interest Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of documents will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
      The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
      <p>
      Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) is available from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/i18n-ig/">Internationalization Interest Group home page.</a></p>
<p>
  The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
      </p>
</section>



      <section id="decisions">
        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Task forces within this group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
<p>
  All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
</p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
        </p>
      </section>



      <section id="patentpolicy">
<h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
            Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
      </section>



      <section id="licensing">
        <h2>Licensing</h2>
        <p>This Interest Group will use the   <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software">W3C Software and Document license</a> for all its deliverables.</p>
      </section>
